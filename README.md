## Developing for Webbous

Webbous leverages React as its development framework, which allows for great
moddability and modularity. You need only create a JSX file with your
functionality and hook it up to `handleCommandSubmit()` in `src/CommandProcessor.jsx`.

In theory, it should work with most React and JSX stuff, but that remains to be
tested.
